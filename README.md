# ❓ Flutter Quiz App – My Second Flutter Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **Quiz App** built with the **Flutter** framework. The quiz content is focused on **Flutter itself**, turning the app into a dual-purpose project: one that helps reinforce Flutter knowledge while also expanding my Flutter development skills.

As my **second Flutter app**, this project represents a deeper dive into Dart and Flutter concepts. It focuses on building **multi-screen navigation**, **state management**, and making better use of **Dart’s functional programming features**.

## ✨ Features

- **Flutter Quiz**  
  A series of multiple-choice questions related to Flutter and Dart.

- **Multiple Screens**  
  Seamless navigation between quiz start, question, and results screens.

- **Dynamic State Updates**  
  The app keeps track of answers, scores, and user progression through lifted and managed state.

- **Functional Dart**  
  Utilizes Dart functions like `map`, `where`, and more to transform and filter quiz data.

- **Stateless & Stateful Widgets**  
  Practiced when and how to use both widget types effectively.

- **Responsive UI Composition**  
  Combined a variety of layout and UI widgets to create a fluid experience.

## 🎯 What I Practiced

This app was a valuable opportunity to reinforce key Flutter skills:

- Creating and managing **multiple screens** with Navigator.
- **Passing data** between screens using constructors.
- Uplifting state to manage quiz progress and answer tracking.
- Distinguishing when to use **StatelessWidget** vs **StatefulWidget**.
- Leveraging Dart’s built-in functions (`map`, `where`, etc.) for cleaner, more expressive logic.
- Structuring widgets in a way that reflects good separation of concerns.

This hands-on experience gave me a much clearer understanding of **Flutter’s widget tree**, **navigation system**, and **reactive UI model**.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Flutter SDK** – Framework for cross-platform development  
- **Dart** – Programming language used by Flutter  
- **Material Design** – For modern, consistent UI components

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed and configured  
- An emulator, simulator, or connected physical device

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matidr/quiz_app.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd flutter_quiz_app
```

Get Flutter packages:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

> ✅ Ensure a device or emulator is connected before running the app.
